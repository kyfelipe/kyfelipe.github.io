Innovation in todayâ€™s organizations comes from software, where all companies are becoming software companies and need to empower their developers to deliver new customer experiences quickly. Innovation can come in many different application formats - from traditional, monolithic applications to cloud-native and 12-factor applications.

These applications must also be able to run across hybrid/multi-cloud and out to the edge. Docker enables organizations to achieve these goals by providing the only end-to-end (desktop to the data center) experience for developing and scaling distributed applications while leveraging the processes, people and tools that they have in place today. In addition to building and running applications, the Docker Platform provides end-to-edge security at scale, without slowing down innovation with automated governance and compliance throughout the application lifecycle.

The Docker platform is built on industry-standard, open source technologies including Docker and Kubernetes. Used by millions of developers and IT professionals worldwide, Docker includes the world's leading container content library and ecosystem with more than 100,000 container images from major software vendors, open-source projects and the community.
